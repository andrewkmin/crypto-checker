# Crypto Checker
## Description:
Lightweight Chrome extension that allows you to quickly check the price of a token/currency, as well as save that search so you can potentially extract patterns from the behavior exhibited when checking prices

## To-do:
* Save each search via Mongo (for later analysis), with optional sentiment fields
* Persistent login (to be able to log into your account and have your data always be there -- may need some kind of Redux store to make this happen)
* Look into other APIs to be able to make API calls with ticker/symbol as opposed to full cryptocurrency name

## Resources:
* Create React App
* MongoDB/Mongoose
* Coinmarketcap API
* Material design
